    "* arrange: sort or order a data frame\n",
    "* select: subset your dataset down to particular columns/variables of interest\n",
    "* filter: subset your dataset down to particular rows/observations of interest\n",
    "* mutate: create and append new variables/columns to your dataset\n",
    "* summarize: compute aggregations, statistics, or other summaries of the data\n",
    "\n",
